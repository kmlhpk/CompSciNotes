# CompSciNotes

Some lecture notes for my Computer Science degree. You may notice there aren't too many - I am not a huge fan of taking notes in lectures, preferring instead to focus on what the lecturer is saying. What notes I do take are usually comments from the lecturer that are not on the slides, since otherwise I run the risk of forgetting these extra details.

For more content that requires workings out, eg. MCS and ToC practicals, I keep exercise books. Sadly, due to their very analogue nature, they don't lend themselves well to version control.
