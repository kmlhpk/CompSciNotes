## Lecture 1

Randomise order of inputs to not overfit the model to a particular order

## Lecture 2

Gradient descent - which direction to travel to mininmise loss

Learning rate - how big steps to take to try not to overshoot the minimum we're searching for

## Lecture 3

Training & Test Set Lecture Slides mistake - Train model on Training Set, Evaluate Model on Validation Set (**Not** Test Set), tweak based on validation set performance
