Runaway argument?
c:/Users/Kamil/Desktop/CompSciNotes/Year 1/Stats/StatsEx13/statsex13.tex:31: Paragraph ended before \@array was complete
I suspect you've forgotten a `}', causing me to apply this
control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.

c:/Users/Kamil/Desktop/CompSciNotes/Year 1/Stats/StatsEx13/statsex13.tex:31: Missing $ inserted
I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

c:/Users/Kamil/Desktop/CompSciNotes/Year 1/Stats/StatsEx13/statsex13.tex:33: Misplaced \crcr
I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
or \cr or \span just now. If something like a right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

c:/Users/Kamil/Desktop/CompSciNotes/Year 1/Stats/StatsEx13/statsex13.tex:33: Extra }, or forgotten \endgroup
I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

c:/Users/Kamil/Desktop/CompSciNotes/Year 1/Stats/StatsEx13/statsex13.tex:33: Missing $ inserted
I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.
