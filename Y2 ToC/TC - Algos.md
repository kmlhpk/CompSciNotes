# COMP22XX Theory of Computation - Algorithms and Complexity

## Lecture 1 - Asymptotic Revision

Algorithm: Computational procedure that takes some value(s) as input and produces some value(s) as output.

Problem: Specifies desired relationship between input and output

An algorithm is correct if for every input instance it halts with the correct output.

A correct algorithm *solves* the problem - we only consider correct algorithms in this course.
