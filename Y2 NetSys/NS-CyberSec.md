# COMP2211 - Networks and Systems - Cyber Security

## Lecture 1 - Intro

> *Computer security is the protection of computer systems against adversarial environments.*

In CyberSec, we aim to **allow intended use** and **prevent unintended use**. We adopt a **Red vs Blue** mindset - attacker vs defender. We must constantly be on the lookout for exposed vulnerabilities and assume attackers may want to exploit them, even if the exploits seem counter-intuitive. We must think from both perspectives to secure our systems.

## Basic Terminology

Word            | Meaning
--              |--
Asset           | Something of **value** to a person or organisation.
Vulnerability   | **Weakness** of a system that could be accidentally or intentionally **exploited** to damage assets.
Threat          | **Potential danger** of an adversary exploiting a vulnerability.
Risk            | Asset x Threat x Vulnerability.
Adversary       | An **agent** that circumvents the security of a system.
Attack          | An **assault** on system security.
Countermeasure  | Actions/processes that an owner may take to **minimize risk** of a vulnerability.
Confidentiality | Ensuring assets are **only available** to those who should be **allowed**.
Integrity       | Ensuring **consistency**, **accuracy** and **trustworthiness** of data.
Availability    | Ensuring that assets are **always available** (e.g. in the event of an attack).
Accountability  | **Recording actions** so that users can be held **accountable** for their actions.
Reliability     | Ensuring that a system can **progress despite errors**.

**Confidentiality, integrity and availability** often have to be balanced against one another. Too much confidentiality might harm availability and integrity, etc.
