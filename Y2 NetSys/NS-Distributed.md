# COMP2xxx Networks and Systems - Distributed Systems

## Lecture 1

Network layers put together = OSI model (physical -> application, 7 layers)

TCP/IP model = 4 or 5 layers (more concise than OSI, we will follow this in practice due to less translation between layers)

Unicasting: End to end, source->dest

Multicasting: one source, multiple destinations (receiving same info)

Components can be made differently (eg different hardware) as long as they produce the same output on the same input - they would still count as the "same" component, since they have no functional difference

You don't necessarily need high computing power in one component - you can have duplicates of low-powered machines, and in high volumes they can connect and provide high computational power
